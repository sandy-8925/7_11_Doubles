This program simulates the 7-11-Doubles drinking game.
The object of the game is to make other players drink their favorite
beverage. Each player takes turns rolling a pair of dice. A winning roll
of the dice occurs if the total of the dice is 7 or 11, or the dice show
doubles (1-1, 2-2, etc.) When the current player rolls a winning
combination, they choose some other player to drink their beverage
and the current player gets to roll again. Any other combination is a
losing roll and the current player's turn is over and the dice are passed
to the next player. If the current player rolls a losing combination and
any other player has not finished drinking, the current player ignores
the losing roll and rolls again. Winning rolls are treated as above. It is
possible for more than one other player to be drinking at the same
time. In this simulation, the game can begin after two players have
joined. The game ends when only one player is left. A player will
leave the game after being made to drink a specified number of
drinks. If the player has drinks remaining, they must finish them, but
should not be assigned any more drinks.
